Hey People!

Nikki here, I'm new to programming. My goal is to create an algo trading strategy usable in the financial markets and also to analyse a myriad of data, from financials to trivias.
The language I'm currently learning are MQL and Python.

PS: I have a soft spot for bakwan jagung and cong fan.
